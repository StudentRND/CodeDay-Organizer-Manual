Because CodeDay is focused on exploration, having fun, and self-driven learning, finding lots of mentors is a lower priority than for many events, and because there are no real prizes, the same is true for judges. That said, finding at least a few judges and mentors is something we ask organizers to do in order to somewhat improve the attendee experience.

# The Role of Mentors

At CodeDay, mentors help teams 

# The Role of Judges

CodeDay has judges largely so students feel somewhat validated in the end result, and because events where "everyone wins" feel more like events schools put on.

At CodeDay, judges arrive at 9am on Sunday, and try each of the student projects. We call this "pre-judging," and its purpose is to avoid giving awards to the teams with the best presentations \(who often put the least work into their actual project\).

After pre-judging, judges watch all the presentations, then give out the following awards:

* Top Overall \(think "first place"\)
* Best Game \(think "second, in the game category"\)
* Best App \(think "second, in the app category"\)
* 0-to-60 \("beginner team which made a lot of progress"\)
* Special Awards

\(You can choose not to award the 0-to-60 and special awards at smaller events.\)

More on the judging procedure is covered in the day-of manual.
