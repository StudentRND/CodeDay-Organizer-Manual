Very little of CodeDay is what you'd traditionally call "event planning." CodeDays are organized starting three months in advance, but typically organizers will only order food a few weeks before the event. Instead, much of what organizers do is make helpful connections with the community and local businesses.

This is more clear when you look at a typical organizing timeline:

* 3 months \(or more\) in advance: talk to companies about hosting\/sponsorship. Secure a venue by the end of this month.
* 2 months in advance: talk to companies about sponsorship, and schools about promotion. Secure at least one sponsor and some promotional agreements from schools by the end of this month.
* 1 month in advance: heavy promotional to students; order food and figure out final logistics.

Each of these topics is addressed in great detail later in the organizer manual, but .
