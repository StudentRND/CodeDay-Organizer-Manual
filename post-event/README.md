# Close Finances

Receipts for all incurred expenses need to be submitted \(this isn't just our policy, it's what the IRS requires\). Expenses should be submitted --

* On Tyler's SRND Amex: forward all receipts to [ap-match-receipt@srnd.org](mailto:ap-match-receipt@srnd.org)
* On your own SRND Amex: wait a few days, then [upload to the "Receipts" section of Abacus.](https://www.abacus.com/receipts)
* On your personal card: [create a reimbursement request in Abacus.](https://www.abacus.com/expenses?filter=me)

If you don't have an Abacus account yet, email accounts@srnd.org from your @srnd.org email for an invite.

Note that Abacus supports both reimbursements, as well as linking receipts to corporate card transactions. If you have a SRND card, make sure you don't request reimbursement for corporate transactions.

# Add Pictures

If you took any pictures at the event, you can have them show up on your city's website by doing the following:

1. [Request to join this Flickr group](https://www.flickr.com/groups/2898458@N20/)
2. Upload all your pictures to Flickr
3. Tag all your pictures with your city's webname
4. Add all photos to the CodeDay group you joined in Step 1

Optionally, if any photos from your city are tagged "bestof", only those photos will show on the homepage. \(This means if your city has used "bestof" before, you have to use it now, or recent photos will never appear.\)

# Thank Yous

We will automatically send general thank-yous and requests for feedback to your venue and sponsors if they're in Clear, however you may want to send a personal note.
