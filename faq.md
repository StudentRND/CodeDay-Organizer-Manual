## How do I get help?

- If you're a general volunteer, ask your RM or ARM.
- Use the Slack at https://chat.srnd.org/. Ask anyone available to invite you to #staff-global if you're not already a member, and ask your question in there.
- Talk to your coach, if you have one.
- Call or text Tyler at (206) 739-4741.

Feel free to do any/all of these, and in particular do not feel bad about asking Tyler for help.


## Other than this guide, how do I get training?

We have regular group calls. You should be getting emails from the events@srnd.org mailing list -- if you're not, please ask your SRND contact for help.

Your coach or other srnd contact should set up frequent 1-1s to talk through your event, if you're new, as well.


## How do I open registrations?

1. Go to clear.codeday.org, click on your event, and then click Venue.
2. Fill out all the fields.
3. Fill out _ALL_ the fields. This includes capacity (which will automatically ell-out the tickets when reached) and venue contact (for future seasons, or in case something happens to you)
4. Go back to the dashboard for your event.
5. Click the "Registrations" switch, and it will turn green.

It takes 1-10 minutes for the website to update.


## Can we teach the beginner workshop in (language)?

No, the beginner workshop needs to be taught in Construct 3. We've had dozens of teams try to teach the beginner workshop in something else, and the results are always quite significantly worse than Construct 3.

You can add other workshops, but please just teach Construct 3 for the beginner one.


## How does the money work?

We collect all ticket revenue and sponsorships, and give you a corporate card to pay for supplies from that account. You never actually need to touch any money directly.


## Why does CodeDay cost money?

CodeDay only kind-of costs money; almost everyone gets a significant discount, and the average price paid ranges from $2 to $9, which is less than the cost of the event. You should be liberal with promo codes and scholarships.

So why charge at all? Well, when CodeDay was free, we had a 40-60% no-show rate, which mostly comprised beginners. Our theory is that, when an event is free, a beginner feels less buy-in, and is more likely to decide "nah, I can't do this" the morning-of.

The cost does also help a bit in terms of cost. (See "What does it cost to host CodeDay?")


## What does it cost to host CodeDay?

1. Food! As an organizer, you are responsible for this cost. We ask that you keep this around $10/person or less. (It's very possible, and many events are around $8.)
2. There are a lot of other direct event costs, as well. Insurance and supplies (awards, signs, etc, and shipping) add an additional $200-1000/event.
3. Sometimes, we offer partial or full travel reimbursements to students traveling from low-income areas. These are usually around $100 for a carpool, or $800-2000 for a school bus.
4. There's a cost associated with our national efforts to improve training, coordinate events, work with school districts and organizations, and start CodeDays in new cities.

Ticket costs cover part of (1), and national sponsorships cover part of (4), but in total, your CodeDay will need $1,000 in sponsorship to break-even.


## What happens if we don't have enough/have too much money?

If you don't have enough money to pay for food after ticket revenue and sponsorships, the extra will come out of our global budget.

If you have extra money, the extra money will cover costs for events that can't raise enough. We count on cities in major tech areas raising more money than needed in order to support cities in areas with few sponsor prospects. (Exception: larger sponsorships specifically for your city.)
