In most ways, finding a venue isn't dramatically different from finding other sponsors:

* Finding both venues and sponsors will require contacting local businesses.
* Venue sponsors are still making a donation, only of time instead of money.
* An initial pitch, a phone meeting, and an approvals process are usually required to close both.
* You should be talking to multiple potential venues, just like you should be talking to multiple potential sponsors.
* Potential venue sponsors who can't commit can still be a regular sponsor.

In this section, we'll cover many of the steps involved in finding a venue, but you'll have more luck if you read the rest of the sponsorships section as well.

# Potential Venues

* ## Co-Working Spaces

* ## Startup Offices

* ## Corporate Offices

* ## Libraries and Other Government Buildings

* ## Schools


# Considerations

* ## Cost

  Venue sponsorship should be just that: sponsorship. That means the venue should almost always be free. It's occasionally ok to pay for a venue, but that's usually limited to covering a cleaning or heating cost of less than $300. If you're expecting to spend money on a venue, you should be confident you can offset it with additional sponsorships.

  Be aware that many "free" venues have contracts requiring use of specific companies, like hiring their A\/V contractor if you're going to use a projector, or ordering food only from their specific caterer. The cost for these locked-in contracts is usually way out of the event budget \(Microsoft's contracted caterer charges $14 per person just for breakfast cereal\). This is usually only an issue in larger buildings, but it's worth asking about and, if there are any requirements, asking if the company will cover the cost as part of the sponsorship.

* ## Size and Layout

  Your specific space requirements will depend on your expected attendance. For new, smaller cities, a venue might need to hold 60 people, while a large, established city like Phoenix will require space for 300-400! Remember, as well, that you'll need to have a space to hold all these people \(standing, if necessary\) for the kickoff and awards.
  For larger events \(above 120\), it's best to have multiple rooms into which you can subdivide the event. Having more than 120 people in one room makes it much less likely that participants will meet people from other teams: it's simply too big.
  The layout of the rooms is also important. Venues with a few big rooms are preferred to those with lots of conference rooms. The goal of CodeDay isn't just to make something cool, it's also to encourage a community, and it's hard to build a community when people lock themselves in a small room. \(If the venue does have lots of conference rooms, can you close them off for the event and still have space in the main rooms?
