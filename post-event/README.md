# Close Finances

Receipts for all incurred expenses need to be submitted \(this isn't just our policy, it's what the IRS requires\). Expenses should be submitted --

* On Tyler's StudentRND Amex: forward all receipts to [ap-match-receipt@srnd.org](mailto:ap-match-receipt@srnd.org)
* On your own StudentRND Amex: wait a few days, then [upload to the "Receipts" section of Abacus.](https://www.abacus.com/receipts)
* On your personal card: [create a reimbursement request in Abacus.](https://www.abacus.com/expenses?filter=me)

If you don't have an Abacus account yet, email ap@srnd.org from your @srnd.org email for an invite.

Note that Abacus supports both reimbursements, as well as linking receipts to corporate card transactions. If you have a StudentRND card, make sure you don't request reimbursement for corporate transactions.

# Debrief

If possible, it's great to get your team in a voice/video call within a week or two of the end of the event to talk about how everything went. Here's a suggested agenda:

* Go around the circle, each person lists their favorite moment of CodeDay
* Discuss what worked and what didn't in promotion
* Discuss how activities went at CodeDay
* Brainstorm other ways to improve planning/etc for next event

# Update Documentation

Anything go particularly well or poorly? Let us know so we can update this guide!
