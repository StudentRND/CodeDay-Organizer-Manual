# Goals and History

StudentRND started out as a student hackerspace in Bellevue, Washington, and CodeDay started out as a fun event to attract students to the space, on the premise of creating a video game in 24 hours. The first event, held in 2011, took little inspiration from the developing concept of hackathons; Adam Ryman \(a volunteer\) and Tyler Menezes \(StudentRND's current Executive Director\) were inspired to run the first event by a month-long game making competition they had [completed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZwYLGz2w4k) in high school.

Since then, CodeDay has expanded dramatically:

* 2012: 5 events in 2 cities
* 2013: 12 events in 7 cities
* 2014: 58 events in 28 cities
* 2015: 70 events in 38 cities

# How It's Different

## From Hackathons

Despite CodeDay's outward similarity to hackathons, its academic origins lead to large differences in its key goals. **Most fundementally, CodeDay is not about being good. It's about learning something new. **After a CodeDay, we evaluate its success based on a few survey questions:

* How much did you know about coding before you attended?
* Did you learn something new?
* Do you plan to keep coding?

\(Two-and-a-half months later, we do a follow-up poll asking whether students _did_ continue coding.\)

Much of the culture which has developed around hackathons is incompatible with these metrics. Big prizes, recruiters, and selectivity make beginners feel unwelcome, and encourage established programmers to play things safe to create a polished final result, but don't encourage trying something new but risky.

For many students, hackathons are about the absolute skill level, while CodeDay is about the delta skill level.

## From Workshops and Classes

Schools and coding schools which teach computer science courses \(and organizations like Code.org which advocate for its universality\) play an important role in making the future generation of technologists, however most students still don't want to learn how to code. This is particularly true in low-income areas, where many of our partner schools report that as few as 7% of students in their CS courses were there by choice \(the rest were placed because it met a requirement\).

CodeDay is designed to appeal to students with little-to-no programming experience, and get them excited to continue. To do this, it differs dramatically from classes and workshops:

* **Hands-on:** CodeDay has little reading, and only brief workshops. Attendees are encouraged to find solutions to their own problems.
* **Creative: **Rather than assignments, students each work on a project they're personally passionate about. By the end of the event, students have created something real from only their imagination.
* **Cross-Dicipline: **The creativity of many of the projects \(particularly game projects\) mean students have an opportunity to use existing interests -- such as art, music, or acting -- while learning about coding. This helps us attract students who don't already consider themselves "programmers".

# Who Comes to CodeDay?

CodeDays average around 120 participants \(newer regions might be closer to 60\), with a typical experience breakdown of:

* 25% Beginners \(people with no prior experience\)
* 50% Intermediate \(people who've taken a CS class or Codecademy\)
* 25% Advanced \(people with lots of experience\)

Because of its focus on beginners, CodeDay tends to be one of the most diverse events in its field. By gender, 40% of CodeDay attendees are girls, and by ethnicity, 28% are from an under-represented group. On average, 38% of CodeDay attendees are from a low-income area.
The age breakdown of a CodeDay is:

* 10% Middle school
* 40% High school
* 50% College

First events in a region may vary more than most, but you should strive for these metrics. That means aggressively promoting in "unusual" places -- something we'll discuss in much greater depth later.
