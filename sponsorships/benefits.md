CodeDay sponsors can usually be described by a few architypes, so we've divided our sponsorship levels into the same architypes. You can download PDFs for each sponsor below:

* [Community](http://assets.srnd.org/codeday/sponsor/community.pdf)
* [Recruiting](http://assets.srnd.org/codeday/sponsor/recruiting.pdf)
* [API](http://assets.srnd.org/codeday/sponsor/api.pdf)
* [Venue](http://assets.srnd.org/codeday/sponsor/venue.pdf)

# What You Can Offer

You can offer _mostly_ anything at your local event without needing to do anything special.

We _recommend_ you follow the levels on [the sponsorship page,](https://srnd.org/sponsor) however you're free to choose any price point for local sponsorships.

Whatever you choose, just make sure your entire team is consistent. If one sponsor pays $1,000 for a workshop, then finds out another only paid $100, they'll likely be upset.

## All Sponsors

* Logo on the website
* 1-minute kickoff slot
* Bring mentors
* Distribute swag

## Larger Sponsors (Recommended $1-2k+)

* 5-minute kickoff (long enough for an API/product demo)
* Host a 45-minute workshop
* Resumes
* Present a **non-product-specific, low-cash-value** award (e.g. "Most technically challenging, presented by Andreessen Horowitz")
* Invite employees to judge
* 45min-60min workshop slot
* Keynote slot

# What You Can't Offer

It's important to consider that, while money is nice, we need to keep the spirit of CodeDay alive. To do this, there are some traditional hackathon benefits we don't allow:

* **Product-specific awards.** These are prizes tied to specific use of a product or service, like "best use of the Xyz API." We don't allow these because we don't want the prizes to feel overly commercialized. General categories (e.g. "best VR game" or "best location-aware app") are fine.
* **Prizes worth more than $100/person.** Large prizes decrease the chance of teams helping each other, increase stress, and make beginners feel unwelcome. They're ok for competitive hackathons, but not for CodeDay.
* **Anything else that might make the event feel competitive or professional.** Use your judgement here: CodeDay is not a hugely commercial hackathon targeting the best programmers in your city. Sponsors often want to treat it that way, but doing so will ruin the experience for the many newer students we invite.

## National Sponsorships

**Please get SRND approval before offering any national benefits.** These require additional effort to pull off, and need to be fair to existing sponsors (who usually pay $5,000-50,000 for similar benefits).

The only exception is the exact national sponsorship offered on the [sponsorship page](https://srnd.org/sponsor) with no more than a 20% discount.
