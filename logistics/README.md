Figuring out logistics for CodeDay involves figuring out much of the day-of plan:

* What resources \(food, volunteers, mentors, etc\) are needed
* Where will those resources come from
* How and when will they be deployed

It's important to do some logistics planning before CodeDay, but you should generally avoid doing it _too _far in advance, because it's often difficult to know exactly how many people will arrive until close to the event \(unless you're managing a fairly established city\).

From past experience, about two weeks before CodeDay seems to be a good time to start planning your logistics. This section will give you some guidance on what your logistics plan should include, and how to create it.
