# [account.srnd.org](https://account.srnd.org/)

To make your life simple, almost everything at SRND will ask you to log in with one account, and you'll only need to remember that one username and password. Your permissions will sync across all our tools.

You can register for an account at any time on account.srnd.org, and you may already have one if you attended a CodeDay.

You'll need to be marked as an organizer before you'll get access to most internal tools. Your SRND representative should have asked you for your username.

# [clear.codeday.org](https://clear.codeday.org/)

Named for its function as a clearinghouse for CodeDay-related data, Clear is largely a glorified database frontend with features specifically designed to reduce the amount of busywork involved in managing your event. You can access it at clear.codeday.org once you've provided your s5 username to your SRND representative.

Tasks on Clear largely fall into two categories: changing event configuration, and managing attendees. Some example tasks:

* See your current registrations and statistics; download an attendee waiver; and partially refund an attendee.
* Add a venue and open registrations.
* Send an email to all attendees, all past attendees, or anyone who's signed up for notifications.
* Generate a promo or scholarship code.
* Add a sponsor.
* Set your shipping address for CodeDay supplies.
* On the morning-of, check in attendees and get an auto-generated kickoff deck.
* Delegate access to any of these features to a volunteer.

Any changes you make to event configuration on Clear will update within a few minutes on codeday.org.

# [mail.srnd.org](https://mail.srnd.org/)

All volunteers get access to an official SRND email address. Specifically, your address will be your_username@srnd.org. \(You can also receive mail at your s5 username @srnd.org, but you'll need to add it as an alias in settings to send from this address.\)

# [chat.srnd.org](https://chat.srnd.org/)

Depending on who you ask, Slack is either a chat room for organizations, or a place where millenial startup employees waste most of their work week. SRND has a Slack, and although it's not required, we've found it to be helpful for peer-to-peer organizer support and getting quick responses from your SRND contacts.
