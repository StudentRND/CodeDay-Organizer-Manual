# Thank Yous

Don't forget to thank the people that made CodeDay happen! It's also a great way to get started on next year's event. Here are some sample emails you can copy-and-paste:

### Venue Thank-You

> Hi \[name\],

> I just wanted to thank you again so much for letting us use your venue for this CodeDay. It was a great event for the students, and they all really appreciated your support.
>
> Please let me know if there were any problems as a result of our use of the space, and we'll work to make it right.
>
> FYI, the next CodeDay is \[date\] and we'd love to have you on board again.
>
> Cheers!

### Sponsor Thank-You

> Hi \[name\],
>
> Just wanted to thank you again for supporting CodeDay this past weekend! If you had any thoughts on your sponsorship, I'd love to hear them!

### Volunteer Thank-You

> Wow, what a weekend! Thanks so much to everyone involved for making this possible, we really couldn't have done it without you. Hope you all caught up on your sleep!

# Close Finances

All receipts for StudentRND-incurred expenses need to either be matched on Abacus \(if you have your own StudentRND card\) or mailed to HQ \(if you're using our card\). If you incurred any expenses on your personal card which need to be reimbursed, you can upload them to the reimbursement section of Abacus.

All your receipts should match a budget item; if not, please let your StudentRND contact know what's different.

# Debrief

If possible, it's great to get your team in a voice/video call within a week or two of the end of the event to talk about how everything went. Here's a suggested agenda:

* Go around the circle, each person lists their favorite moment of CodeDay
* Discuss what worked and what didn't in promotion
* Discuss how activities went at CodeDay
* Brainstorm other ways to improve planning/etc for next event

# Update Documentation

Anything go particularly well or poorly? Let us know so we can update this guide!
