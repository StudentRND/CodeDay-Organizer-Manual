Figuring out logistics for CodeDay involves figuring out much of the day-of plan:

* What resources \(food, volunteers, mentors, etc\) are needed
* Where will those resources come from
* How and when will they be deployed

It's important to do some logistics planning before CodeDay, but you should generally avoid doing it \_too \_far in advance, because it's often difficult to know exactly how many people will arrive until close to the event \(unless you're managing a fairly established city\).

From past experience, about two weeks before CodeDay seems to be a good time to start planning your logistics. This section will give you some guidance on what your logistics plan should include, and how to create it.



Your final logistics plan should take the form of a document distributed to your volunteers. If you'd like to start by copying a sample, here's an excellent one from CodeDay Philly:
