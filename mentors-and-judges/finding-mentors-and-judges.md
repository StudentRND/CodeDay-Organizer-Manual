# Finding Mentors

We recommend you do not actively seek to recruit mentors; there are usually a surplus of interested individuals, so any time you spend could be better used elsewhere. A slight exception is that you should always ask sponsors if they want to bring any mentors.

When someone expresses interest in becoming a mentor, you should evaluate their:

* **Maturity:** In our experience, many younger mentors behave unprofessionally at events.
* **Experience Level: **Mentors should be generall experienced enough to solve problems in languages or frameworks they haven't used.
* **Ability to Teach:** Mentors are expected to teach students, which means asking questions and helping students understand key concepts, not just directly answer questions.
* **Tech-Curmudgeon Tendencies:** Mentors getting into arguments with students about which programming language is best is neither friendly nor supportive.

Mentors are expected to commit to at least a two-hour shift sometime on Saturday. You can find more information on getting mentors signed up in the "Mentor Management" section.

# Finding Judges

You can often build a panel of judges within a week or two by emailing past contacts, even those who weren't able to help. You can use the following email as a template when getting in touch:

> Hi \[name\],
>
> Would you have any interest in being a judge for this upcoming CodeDay, on Sunday, \[date of judging\] from 9am-noon?
>
> It's pretty low-pressure, you'll get to try the apps/games students made, watch some short presentations, and then give out a few awards. \(No prizes, so it's pretty low-pressure.\)
>
> I can send over more information; does that sound at all interesting?

Once someone agrees to judge, you can send them the following sheet with more information: [http://assets.srnd.org/codeday/judges.pdf](http://assets.srnd.org/codeday/judges.pdf) \(Physical copies for day-of are included in your CodeDay supplies.\)
