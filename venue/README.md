In most ways, finding a venue isn't dramatically different from finding other sponsors:

* Finding both venues and sponsors will require contacting local businesses.
* Venue sponsors are still making a donation, only of time instead of money.
* An initial pitch, a phone meeting, and an approvals process are usually required to close both.
* You should be talking to multiple potential venues, just like you should be talking to multiple potential sponsors.
* Potential venue sponsors who can't commit can still be a regular sponsor.

In this section, we'll cover many of the steps involved in finding a venue, but you'll have more luck if you read the sponsorships section as well.

You can download a sheet to provide to venues \(only once they've expressed interest, not in the first email!\) [here.](http://assets.srnd.org/codeday/sponsor/venue.pdf)
