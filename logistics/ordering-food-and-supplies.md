StudentRND will pay for the food for your event: we will either get you a corporate StudentRND American Express card, give you our card info for orders, or reimburse you, depending on what works easiest for you.

In order for us to pay for food, however, you will need to submit a food plan at least one week in advance of the event. Your food plan should include:

* Lunch
* Dinner
* Midnight snack
* Breakfast \(only for 33% of your expected attendance -- most students don't eat breakfast\)
* Soda \(1-2 cans per person; do not get bottles, they tend to spill\)
* Cups for water,  plates, anything else you need

If you're not sure how many attendees you plan for, talk to your StudentRND contact.

# Spending Breakdown

When ordering food, your goal is under $10 a person. To first-time organizers, that may seem low, but 90% of over 200 events were able to meet that goal \(see "Recommended Vendors" below for suggestions\).

If possible, try to find restaurants which will sponsor meals \(or sponsors who'll agree to order food for a meal\). This is another reason why creating your food plan early is important.

With no food sponsorships, you should aim for the following food breakdown:

* Lunch: $3/person
* Dinner: $4/person
* Breakfast: \($2/person \* 33% =\) $0.66/person
* Soda: $0.50/person
* Midnight Snack: $1/person
* Other supplies: $0.50/person

# Recommended Vendors

* Lunch and Dinner
  * Domino's -- Look in the deals section, you can often find deals which bring the price down to $1-2/person. Medium will feed 3 people at lunch, 2 people at dinner. Large will feed 4/3 respectively. Mediums are often a better deal.
  * Papa John's -- More expensive than Domino's, but you can often find 25-40% off coupons on Google.
  * Subway -- You can order catering online, but you can usually get a discount if you call the store. Order sandwich platters from catering, not individual subs.
  * Jimmy John's -- Order sandwich trays, not individual sandwiches.
* Breakfast
  * Costco -- Muffins \(avoid the ones with nuts in case of allergies\) and fruits \(bananas/apples\)
  * Safeway -- Yogurt, pop-tarts, bagels
  * Regional bagel stores -- Will often give you discounted/free unsold bagels if you have someone pick it up before they close
* Soda
  * Safeway "Refreshe" Brand Soda -- Almost always $0.12-0.25/can with a Safeway club card.
* Midnight Snack
  * Any Supermarket Ice Cream/Root Beer -- Root Beer floats.
  * Krispy Kreme -- Will usually do discounts for nonprofits.
* Other Supplies
  * Costco
  * Instacart -- More expensive than most, avoid if possible
