All events should create a schedule -- both for your own use \(it's easy to visualize what the event will look like once you've gone through the effort of writing it down\) as well as for your volunteers.

Smaller events can often get by with a rough schedule like the following \(created by Victor from CodeDay Philly\):

| **Pre Event** | **Kickoff** | **Afternoon** | **Evening** | **Overnight** | **Morning** | **Post Event** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Grocery Run, Lunch Pickup,  Event Setup, Registration** | **Keynote, Registration** | **Serve Lunch, Workshop Instructor, Workshop TA, Dinner Pickup** | **Serve Dinner, Ping Pong Tournament** | **Serve Midnight Snack, Hype Team** | **Breakfast Pickup, Serve Breakfast, Talk to Judges** | **Takedown, Venue Follow-Up** |

Most organizers of larger events find things easier to manage with the help of a comprehensive schedule, so we recommend that all organizers of events with more than 100 people create one. Your schedule should include plans for setup, activities, workshops, food, and everything from the general CodeDay schedule.

If you're picking up any supplies or food on the day-of, make sure to include realistic estimates of when people should leave and when they should be back. Be sure to clarify who's going, as well.

You can base this on the schedule on the public website, or use the following sample schedule \(created by Kevin from CodeDay Columbia\):
