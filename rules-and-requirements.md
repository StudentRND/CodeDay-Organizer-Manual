We hope this goes without saying, but all our organizers are expected to respect the [StudentRND Code of Conduct;](https://srnd.org/code-of-conduct) violations will result in your immediate removal from your position as an organizer. As a leader of your community, there are no second chances for sending the right message.

With that out of the way, let's get into some requirements you're less likely to already know:

## The Time and Date are Fixed

CodeDay starts at noon on a Saturday and ends at noon on a Sunday, and it happens in all cities simultaneously. We very rarely make exceptions to this rule, and it's usually to test out a new event format, not just because a venue prefers another weekend.

## Events Must be Public and Geographic

You can't run a CodeDay just for your school or organization, it must be open to the public. In general, the name of any individual CodeDay will be the name of a city or state, and never a venue or partner organization.

## Only Approved Sponsorship Benefits

Sponsors are important, but not so important that it's ok to dilute the CodeDay brand. The most common requests you can't allow:

* No prizes over $100\/person \(and no cash prizes at all\)
* No co-branding -- sponsors will be listed on the website, but we can't call it "WidgeCo CodeDay Seattle"

Most sponsors bring mentors and swag, speak at the kickoff, and\/or get access to opt-in student data. You can see a full list of normal and approved benefits in the sponsorships section. For unusual requests, please check with your StudentRND contact before agreeing.

## We'll Run the Website

You should not set up your own CodeDay website, please use Clear to manage your sub-page on codeday.org \(you can find out more about Clear on the Tools page\). If you have problems\/suggestions\/requests, please forward them to your StudentRND contact. So far we've been able to meet most requests.

## We'll Collect Sponsorships and Ticket Costs, and We'll Pay for Food

To maintain our tax-exempt status, all money needs to pass through StudentRND.

CodeDay.org is the only place you can collect money for tickets \(so don't set up an EventBrite\). If you're planning to sell tickets in-person, such as at a school event, talk to your StudentRND contact. Likewise, sponsorship checks should be made payable to StudentRND and sent to the address on our website \(or donated by card online\); your StudentRND contact can generate an invoice if required.

On the other hand, we'll either give you a credit card on which you can make event-related purchases \(if possible\), or set you up for reimbursements on your personal card. You'll need to save all receipts, and you can only use this for event-related purchases which are in your approved budget. \(More on this in the logistics section.\)

## Code Evangelist Training is Separate

To run things like the kickoff, workshops, and lead the mentors, you need to go through our Code Evangelist training, which is totally separate, and focuses on how to make the day-of experience great. This means:

* If you want to run things on the day-of, you should let us know early.
* If you don't want to run things on the day-of, you're off the hook! \(But let us know that, too.\)
