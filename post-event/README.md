# Close Finances

Receipts for all incurred expenses need to be submitted \(this isn't just our policy, it's what the IRS requires\). Expenses should be submitted --

* On Tyler's StudentRND Amex: forward all receipts to [ap-match-receipt@srnd.org](mailto:ap-match-receipt@srnd.org)
* On your own StudentRND Amex: wait a few days, then [upload to the "Receipts" section of Abacus.](https://www.abacus.com/receipts)
* On your personal card: [create a reimbursement request in Abacus.](https://www.abacus.com/expenses?filter=me)

If you don't have an Abacus account yet, email ap@srnd.org from your @srnd.org email for an invite.

Note that Abacus supports both reimbursements, as well as linking receipts to corporate card transactions. If you have a StudentRND card, make sure you don't request reimbursement for corporate transactions.

# Add Pictures

If you took any pictures at the event, you can have them show up on your city's website by doing the following:

1. [Request to join this Flickr group](https://www.flickr.com/groups/2898458@N20/)
2. Upload all your pictures to Flickr
3. Tag all your pictures with your city's webname with no hyphens \(e.g. atlanta or seattleeastside\)
4. Add all photos to the CodeDay group you joined in Step 1

Optionally, if any photos from your city are tagged "bestof", only those photos will show on the homepage. \(This means if your city has used "bestof" before, you have to use it now, or recent photos will never appear.\)

# Debrief

If possible, it's great to get your team in a voice/video call within a week or two of the end of the event to talk about how everything went. Here's a suggested agenda:

* Go around the circle, each person lists their favorite moment of CodeDay
* Discuss what worked and what didn't in promotion
* Discuss how activities went at CodeDay
* Brainstorm other ways to improve planning/etc for next event

# Update Documentation

Anything go particularly well or poorly? Let us know so we can update this guide!
