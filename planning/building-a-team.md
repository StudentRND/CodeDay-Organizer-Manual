If you take a look at the most successful CodeDay cities, you'll be a bit confused. Seattle, San Francisco, and New York make sense, sure. But how about Phoenix?

Why is Phoenix on the list? Because they built a team that can lead the event to success.

Building a great team is not usually live-or-die for a CodeDay, but it does make the diference between a CodeDay, and a really great CodeDay. In this section, we'll explore what makes a team great, how to recruit a team, and how to manage a team once you have them.

# Roles

* ## Regional Manager \(RM\)

  The Regional Manager is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the event \(at least until the day-of\), and is almost always the member of the team who works most closely with the StudentRND global team. Smaller, newer cities may have only a Regional Manager who fills all the remaining roles.

  In established cities, it's still expected that the Regional Manager will be directly involved in getting a venue, finding sponsors, and promoting. However, as cities become larger, Regional Managers find themselves working more and more on recruiting, training, and managing the rest of the teams.

* ## Assistant Regional Manager \(ARM\)

  Unlike, say, an Administrative Assistant, this role isn't all scheduling and email. Expectations for the ARM closely mirror those for the primary Regional Manager: work with the other teams to make CodeDay happen! \(Or, in smaller cities, help the RM complete tasks from all the roles.\)

  This role serves two purposes: spreading the work between two people on large teams, and training a replacement RM, since team members usually serve only a few years. \(Because of the latter purpose, it's recommended to recruit an ARM who's going to be around for a while.\)

* ## Sponorships and Venue Team

  The sponsorships and venue team work to find a venue \(priority zero\) and monetary and in-kind sponsors \(priority two\). They're responsible for populating and updating the list of sponsor targets in the event plan, emailing and calling those targets, and getting as much sponsorship as possible for the event.

  In addition to the training provided to the sponsorships in this guide, StudentRND provides additional training sessions, practice sessions, and one-on-ones to all members of Sponsorships and Venue teams. Details for the specific training schedule will be provided to Regional Managers and should be communicated to this team.

* ## Community Partnerships Team

  This team focuses making promotion-focused connections with local organizations and the news media \(and schools which aren't already served by school liasons\).

  Community Partnerships is responsible for filling the partners section of the event plan with a comprehensive list of organizations which have members who may be interested in CodeDay, and reaching out to build partnerships.

  _Partnerships_ is a keyword for this team. They don't hang flyers, but build relationships with individuals at relevant organizations which can be used in future CodeDays. The work is documented in detail in the "Promotion" section.

* ## Community Liasons

  This team comprises students at schools across the region, who work to get CodeDay announced in classes, clubs, and announcements. They also post flyers in their school \(if possible\) and community, and -- most importantly -- personally invite friends.

  Because this team has no specific deliverables of their own, they should work closely with the Community Partnerships team, who can update their spreadsheet to reflect what promotion has been done in which schools.

  Usually one student per school is plenty except in large schools. In addition to recruiting team members specifically for this role, this is one role which all team members with a connection to a local school should serve.
