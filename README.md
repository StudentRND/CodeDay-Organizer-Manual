Thank you for organizing CodeDay! We're really excited to have you join us!

From the stories we've heard -- from friendships made to career paths changed -- it's clear that CodeDay means a lot to tens of thousands of students nationwide. By becoming an organizer, you're becoming part of the small group which makes the event possible. We're not the only ones who will be thankful you decided to join us!

Over the years we've learned that a lot goes into making a CodeDay successful. We've been developing this guide over the past five years based on feedback from hundreds of organizers. What often felt to early organizers like a stressful haze looming over their lives for three months is now described by organizers as fun and rewarding.

# How to Use This Manual

Okay, so no one ever said "stressful haze looming over one's life," but the point is this: we've collected years and thousands of person-hours into this guide so your CodeDay organizing experience will be easy and the attendees will have a great time.

This guide is broken down into topical sections, and describes both the high-level goals, and the specific tasks needed to achieve them. Because it's important to know what work needs to happen when, the most successful organizers have typically read the whole intro and event planning sections before they start.

You should also bookmark this manual for future reference. The most useful part of this manual will be those specific tasks: they're the best place to start if you don't have a lot of experience in a subject, and work 90% of the time.

# Working With StudentRND

StudentRND is the non-profit which runs CodeDay.

CodeDay isn't only an event format, it's a nationally-recognized brand which gets students excited, and which carries high expectations for students. Because we want to exceed their expectations \(and we want to protect our trademark\), you need to be working with StudentRND before you can call your event a "CodeDay".

\(If you're not working with us yet, but you want to be, email organize@srnd.org. Otherwise, you can still use this guide, just choose another name.\)

Working with us also means you get access to a lot of resources beyond a few hundred kb of markdown on a website! We totally expect you'll have a lot of questions, and at least a few problems, when organizing this event, so we've set up a number of resources for you:

* Weekly or bi-weekly \(depending on how things are going\) one-on-one calls to troubleshoot specific problems, for the lead organizer.
* Bi-weekly group hangouts to hear thoughts and ideas from other organizers.
* 24\/7 email\/text\/phone support for more urgent requests.
* Help from other organizers on Slack.

We'll send you information on all of this when the organizing season starts.  
**Don't live in a bubble!** We'll always try to reach you at least every two weeks to check in, but we strongly recommend  take advantage of the other available help: together we can run the most successful event possible.
