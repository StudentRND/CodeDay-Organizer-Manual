When it comes to promoting your event, social media can go a long way... sorta. Social media won't help you get attendees to your first event, but it _will _help you get more attendees to your _next_ event, so it's worth some investment.

Social media can improve promotion in two ways:

1. **Local social media **promotes what your attendees do, which helps attract friends.
2. **Global social media** helps attendees feel part of a bigger movement.

Certain social media platforms are better suited to one task or the other.:

* Local: Snapchat, Facebook
* Global: Twitter, Instagram, also Facebook
