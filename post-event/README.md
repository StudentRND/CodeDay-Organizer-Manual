# Close Finances

Receipts for all incurred expenses need to be submitted \(this isn't just our policy, it's what the IRS requires\). Expenses should be submitted --

* On Tyler's SRND Amex: forward all receipts to [ap-match-receipt@srnd.org](mailto:ap-match-receipt@srnd.org)
* On your own SRND Amex: wait a few days, then [upload to the "Receipts" section of Abacus.](https://www.abacus.com/receipts)
* On your personal card: [create a reimbursement request in Abacus.](https://www.abacus.com/expenses?filter=me)

If you don't have an Abacus account yet, email accounts@srnd.org from your @srnd.org email for an invite.

Note that Abacus supports both reimbursements, as well as linking receipts to corporate card transactions. If you have a SRND card, make sure you don't request reimbursement for corporate transactions.
