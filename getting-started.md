So you're a new organizer? We're excited to meet you! Here's what you should do to get started:

1. Create an account on [account.srnd.org](https://account.srnd.org/). Tell your SRND contact this username.
2. Log into your new email at [mail.srnd.org](https://mail.srnd.org/). Your email address is (username)@srnd.org. It's more professional if you use this, but if you're not going to, set up forwarding.
3. Join the SRND Slack: [chat.srnd.org](https://chat.srnd.org/). We will invite you to the SRND staff room and your city's staff room.
4. Once your SRND contact sets it up, log into the event management system at [clear.codeday.org](https://clear.codeday.org/) and have a look around.
5. Read through the early sections of this guide, through to the end of Getting a Venue.

# Resources for Organizers

Throughout the season, you'll have access to other helpful resources:

* Weekly or bi-weekly (depending on how things are going) one-on-one calls to troubleshoot specific problems, for the lead organizer.
* Bi-weekly group hangouts to hear thoughts and ideas from other organizers.
* 24/7 email/text/phone support for more urgent requests.
* Help from other organizers on Slack.

You'll get information on these meetings from your SRND contact, (in your @srnd.org email).

**Don't live in a bubble!** We'll always try to reach you at least every two weeks to check in, but we strongly recommend  take advantage of the other available help. Together, our organizers have run more than 300 events; we have the knowledge to help you make yours awesome.
