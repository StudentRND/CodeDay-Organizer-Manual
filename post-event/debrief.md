2011-era CodeDay was 10% of the event it is today; we've only managed to be so successful through making incremental improvements over the course of hundreds of events.

The best way for your event to be a part of that is by debriefing your team. Here are some questions you can ask to help completely debrief the event:

# Event Planning

- Venue
  - How organized was the process of finding the venue? Can we speed it up next season?
  - What criteria did we use to decide on this venue? Should it be changed?
- Promotion
  - Which outreach channels got the most students to register?
  - Which partnerships might be valuable for next season?
  - Anyone we tried to partner with but couldn't? How will we outreach to them next season?
- Sponsorships
  - How many sponsors did we reach out to? What was the success percentages in:
    - Getting a response to your email?
    - Getting someone on the phone?
    - Getting a "yes?"
