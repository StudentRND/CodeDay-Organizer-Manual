For most events, the only thing you'll need to do is add your mentors or judges to Clear with the appropriate ticket type. We'll automatically:

* Send them event details and a reminder
* Let them know what to expect and their expectations
* Conduct a background check if required
* (Try to) schedule mentors for a training webinar

# Scheduling

When you add a mentor to Clear, we let them know that, unless they hear from you, they are welcome to attend any time from 2pm-midnight for at least two hours. (We find these are the times when mentors can be most useful.)

If you're managing a larger event, you may want to email mentors to schedule a shift. We're currently developing a tool to make this easier, but you can use a Google Sheet in the meantime (similar to the one you can use for scheduling staff).

# SRND-Added Judges and Mentors

Some people apply to be a mentor or judge on codeday.org/volunteer, or through their employer (if they're a sponsor). We screen these people, and if they look reasonable, we create tickets for them in Clear.

Because of this, **it's super important that you add your mentors and judges to Clear, or we won't know if you have too many.**

You can find which mentors/judges were added in the weekly summary emails generated by Clear, or using the Clear integration with your #staff-city channel in Slack.
