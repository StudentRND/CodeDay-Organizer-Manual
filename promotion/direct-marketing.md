The effect of directly marketing to students is often underestimated: for organizers who are local to the area, talking to friends and potential friends is an extremely effective way to increase CodeDay attendance. It's no surprise that many of the most successful CodeDays have a strong program of Community Liasons \(see the section on Building a Team for more information on this role\).

To find an initial group of Community Liasons, we recommend contacting previous CodeDay attendees and asking for volunteers to help with the event. Here's a sample email you can use for the purpose:

> Hi there!
> 
> I'm starting the planning job for the next CodeDay, and am currently looking for people to help with planning, promotion, finding sponsors, and more.
> 
> If you liked CodeDay, will you consider helping out in one of these roles? It's not a big time commitment, there are no required skills, and it counts as community service in case you need it!
> 
> Let me know if you're interested or have questions. :\)

You should make sure all Community Liasons are provided with an abundant supply of stickers and at least one CodeDay shirt \(talk to your StudentRND contact to request that we ship them some\).
